**Chroma and Ollama Exploration**

Explored Chroma, a retrieval-augmented generation tool, and Ollama, a platform that promises significant improvements in embedding capabilities. Investigated their functionalities through various online resources, including YouTube tutorials, official documentation, and GitHub repositories.

**Understanding Embedding Basics**

Engaged in educational content, such as YouTube videos and blog posts, to gain a deeper understanding of word embeddings, word2vec, and sentence embeddings. Studied the importance of embeddings in natural language processing and the applications of vector search techniques.

**Technical Deep Dive**

Dived into technical aspects such as approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) algorithms, k-means clustering, and the FAISS library for efficient similarity search. Explored how graph-based ANN methods like HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) can contribute to our projects requiring fast and accurate retrieval.

**Practical Applications**

Explored real-world applications of embedding databases and semantic search in areas such as content discovery, content recommendation, and search result ranking. Evaluated potential use cases within our organization and how these technologies could improve our workflows and customer experiences.

**Resource Gathering**

Collected relevant resources, including links to tutorials, documentation, research papers, and open-source projects, for further team exploration and potential implementation.
